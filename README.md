# Econometrics
A refresher on quant economics with Python.

Econometrics problems will be taken from various textbooks and Python library documentations/examples. 

Primary modules/libraries utilized: 
* statsmodels
* pandas
* scipy 
* numpy


## Statsmodels Library
Statsmodels is a Python module that provides classes and functions for the estimation of many different statistical models, as well as for conducting statistical tests, and statistical data exploration. An extensive list of result statistics are available for each estimator. The results are tested against existing statistical packages to ensure that they are correct. The package is released under the open source Modified BSD (3-clause) license. The online documentation is hosted at [statsmodels.org](www.statsmodels.org).


## Pandas Library
[pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/about.html) is an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.

## Scipy Library
The [SciPy library](https://www.scipy.org/scipylib/index.html) is one of the core packages that make up the SciPy stack. It provides many user-friendly and efficient numerical routines such as routines for numerical integration and optimization.

## Numpy Library
[NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It contains among other things:

* a powerful N-dimensional array object

* sophisticated (broadcasting) functions

* useful linear algebra, Fourier transform, and random number capabilities

* Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data.    

* Arbitrary data-types can be defined. This allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases.

NumPy is licensed under the BSD license, enabling reuse with few restrictions.
