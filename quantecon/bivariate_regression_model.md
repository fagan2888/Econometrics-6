The bivariate regression model is yi=α+βxi+εi.

β: slope parameter. Indicates the change in y associated with an increase of X by one unit. 

α: intercept parameter. Indicates the expected value of Y when X is zero. 

#add equation for: OLS estimates between Beta hats by minimizing the sum of squared residuals.
